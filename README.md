# PHP MVC framework

This is a simple MVC framework for building web applications in PHP. It's free and [open-source](LICENSE).

## MVC Architecture
The Model-View-Control (MVC) pattern, originally formulated in the late 1970s, is a software architecture pattern built on the basis of keeping the presentation of data separate from the methods that interact with the data. In theory, a well-developed MVC system should allow a front-end developer and a back-end developer to work on the same system without interfering, sharing, or editing files either party is working on.
